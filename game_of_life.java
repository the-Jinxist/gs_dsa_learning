According to Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the m x n grid board, return the next state.

    //This is actually quite straightforward. Firstly, you'll need to know the exact ways to check the neigbhours. They are:
    //if i is the row and j is the column
    //[i-1][j-1] top left of the current cell
    //[i-1][j] directly above the current cell
    //[i-1][j+1] top right of the current cell
    //[i][j-1] cell before the current cell
    //[i][j] current cell🌚
    //[i][j+1] cell after the current cell
    //[i+1][j-1] bottom left of the current cell
    //[i+1][j] cell directly below the current cell
    //[i+1][j+1] bottom right cell of the current cell
    
    //After knowing this create a variable to store the live count
    //Then run the live count through the rules already stated/

    //Remeber to use another multi-dimensional array to store the changed values
    //then set the original multi-dimensional array to the new mutlidimensional array.
